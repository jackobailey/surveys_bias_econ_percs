# Political Surveys Bias Voters' Self-Reported Economic Perceptions

<!-- <center><img src=""></center> -->

## Abstract

To hold governments to account for the state of the economy, voters must first understand how it has changed. Yet the perceptions they report often show signs of clear partisan bias. At present, we do not know if this bias is real or instead a result of priming in political surveys. I test this here using an original survey experiment. I assign subjects at random to a political or non-political survey, record their economic perceptions, then compare the results for each group. I find that political surveys do worsen partisan bias, though only among incumbent supporters. As we would expect, these subjects tend to be more positive when primed to consider party politics. Still, much partisan bias remains unexplained, even in the non-political condition. Thus, while economic perception items are not perfect, we can at least be sure that most people respond to them in a similar way in different survey contexts.
